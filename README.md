# Gradle Trial Using Todo

This is just a simple playground project to experiment with Gradle's defaults, dependency management and plugins.

## Usage

Clone the repo, run `gradle build` from the root directory.  If successful, you should be able to run the example by running:

    java -cp build/classes/main es.perryjon.todo.ToDoApp

at the command line from the `ToDo/` directory, assuming you have java installed and paths are correctly setup.

## Credit

Most initial source was pulled from or heavily inspired by Benjamin Mushko's book *Gradle in Action*.  Adaptations and changes will be made as experimentation continues.
